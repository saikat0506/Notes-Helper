// 1. Set the starting counter to 0
let counter = 0;

// 2. Create a variable, step, to increase your counter by
let step = 10; // You can change this value as needed

// 3. Add a do while loop
do {
    console.log("Counter:", counter); // Print the counter
    counter += step; // Increment by step
} while (counter < 100); // 4. Continue until counter is equal to or more than 100
